## Examining the relationship between air pollution, socioeconomic status and cardiovascular mortality rates and determining if air pollution and socioeconomic status influence cardiovascular mortality rates in disadvantaged populations.

Disparities in air pollution exposure have increasingly drawn attention as a public health and social justice issue. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a pollutant linked to industrial activity and human activity, has been shown to elevate risks for cardiovascular disease mortality, especially among populations in economically disadvantaged communities (Crouse et al., 2012; Di et al., 2017). Our research investigates whether there is a statistical relationship between cardiovascular disease mortality rates (CMR) and long-term PM2.5 exposure, and whether socioeconomic status influences this relationship. This analysis applies a data science framework to assess patterns, focusing on the intersection of environmental burden and socioeconomic factors. This study contributes to the growing body of research emphasizing the need for social justice policies that protect vulnerable populations and address health disparities driven by structural inequality.

## Exploring the socioeconomic determinants of health in Washington, D.C., and assessing how socioeconomic factors‚Äîsuch as poverty, age, and lack of health insurance‚Äîcontribute to hypertension prevalence.

Hypertension remains a leading public health concern, especially in urban environments shaped by structural inequalities. This research investigates how social and economic conditions influence hypertension prevalence at the census tract level in Washington, D.C. By integrating data from the CDC and U.S. Census Bureau, the study applies statistical modeling to assess whether variables such as poverty, age, and insurance coverage are predictive of hypertension rates.The results reveal that neighborhoods with higher poverty and older populations experience significantly higher hypertension prevalence. While multivariate regression highlights challenges such as multicollinearity, bivariate models confirm poverty and age as strong independent predictors. Visualizations and spatial mapping further demonstrate that the most affected areas are concentrated in D.C.‚Äôs southeastern and central neighborhoods‚Äîcommunities often facing compounded structural disadvantage.This analysis contributes to the literature on health disparities by combining quantitative data with a public health justice lens. It emphasizes the importance of considering fundamental social determinants and calls for data-informed, community-specific strategies to address the disproportionate burden of hypertension. Future phases of this work will include patient-level data to build a more granular understanding of how lived experiences intersect with structural risk factors.[link here](https://github.com/quant-shop/census/blob/5091a0aa2a8ae0f5fbd1899f31e0aa41e6400923/census/HypertensioninD.C.MultifactorialAnalysis.Rmd).
